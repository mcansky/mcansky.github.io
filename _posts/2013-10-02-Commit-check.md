As I discussed few days ago sticking to a proper style is quite important.

I found out about a set of gems and tools that can do that for you.

The [**overcommit**](http://causes.github.io/blog/2013/05/30/overcommit-the-opinionated-git-hook-manager) and **Rubocop** gems allow you to add an automatic syntax check to your commit. It will check both your code (js, ruby, python, haml, ...) and your commit message.


I was kind of saving a dirty Sed script somewhere to do that, this might come in handy for my work.

And indeed it does. I am wondering if it might be a tad too painful to go through the checks each time, but it might be interesting to either grab what ever bits my brain miss or to force me to stick to my principles.

Let's experiment then !
