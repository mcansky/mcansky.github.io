As I discussed few days ago sticking to a proper style is quite important.

I found out about a set of gems and tools that can do that for you.

The **overcommit** and **Rubocop** gem allow you to add an automatic syntax check to your commit. It will check both your code (js, ruby, python, haml, ...) and your commit message.

I was kind of saving a dirty Sed script somewhere to do that, this might come in handy for my work.
