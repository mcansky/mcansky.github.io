A good friend asked me for some feedback about the Ergodox and since it's been a month I think it's a good time to share how things have been going.

I have been carrying it back and forth between home and work as I did not want to leave it at the office and also liked the idea to use at home for my personal use.

## The first few days

_The very first few days were very slow_. While I was used to typing on a qwerty keyboard I was not used to touch type. The first few days were a bit of a pain to figure how exactly to type because of the split design and my bad habits.

> I printed a small picture of the layout and kept it for the first week on the desk and it did help.

## Using the home row

_Contrary to a classic keyboard the rows are not staggered, instead the columns are a little bit_. As a result you have to rely a lot more on using the proper finger for each column. That's why the _home row_ is so important since it gives you a reference. From there your indexes and pinkies will do some extra work to reach the extra columns on right and left but the other fingers will mostly stay in their column only.

That was, and still, is the biggest challenge for me. It requires a bit of training to do and since I apparently gained most of my typing speed by over using some of my fingers those habits now slow me down or cause me to stop to learn a more approriate way to type some keys.

> After the last 2 weeks of solid use all day plus some "training" online I find myself typing a bit better than before and searching for the home row even on regular keyboards. So you do get used to it, faster than you'd think.

## Typing itself

_Typing itself on the ergodox is pleasant_. I would not say I will refuse to use anything else but using mechanical switches has some specific feeling to it for sure.
The switches are not clicky but if I type a bit strongly and push the key all the way down it's quite noisy. You can clearly ear me typing if you are in the same room as me.

The split design is quite pleasant and is probably one of the biggest interest of the ergodox for me. I can put the two halves on each side of the laptop (mbp 11" or 13") so I get to let my arms rest alongside my body instead of turned inwards. As a result I can seat in a better posture with my back straigh and the shoulders set in a more open angle. This is no small thing. For a guy my size it clearly improves air flow to the lungs (and oxygenation), general back posture and head position too.

The second big design bit are the thumb pads. I use them mainly for 4 keys : enter, space, backspace and Apple CMD. On the 8 x1 keys around them I have a combination of page up and down, alt and ctrl keys. I don't really use them due to their awkward placement so I will probably change the layout a bit soon to make it easier to use ctrl and alt keys there.

> The split design and the thumb zones are really great to use especially considering the overall posture improvement.

## Specific typing

_Typing text such as this blog post is easy, typing code is a bit different_. Ruby is the main language I use and it relies on a lot of {}, () and [] and a lot of ':' or '.'. All those are quite accessible on the qwerty layout I am using but do require some time to get used to. The curlies and squares are on each side of the right half so it required a couple of days to have that set in mind.

For now I don't find much difference in using the Ergodox for typing code compared to a regular keyboard. The use of the thumbs for some of the very used keys such as space, enter and backspace make it really easy to type without moving the hands much. That's a big plus.

The use of the home row make it also easier to code without moving my hand much. This is quite enjoyable when really focused on my work as only my fingers will move.

> While some keys are set in different places the previous section also applies here and make typing code a more enjoyable thing too.

## Many keys

_Compared to a laptop's keyboard the ergodox has probably a few more keys_. The modifiers and extra columns on the side are a bit awkward still at times. While the indexes can easily take the extra journey around to the 5th column or even the extra one without trouble they usually are short to reach the top corner in their area, pushing you to move the entire hand to reach it. If, like me, you use Vim and have the esc. key as one of those you will quickly start to think of a better place where you can put it.

Some of the extra keys are used for layer switching and that's probably a good use for the keys a bit too far for your fingers. You want to keep the keys you can reach easily for keys you use often so it's a good thing you can alter the layout.

> In short : I have pretty regular sized hands for a guy I think and I do find it a bit hard to reach some keys. With some time you find better placement for some keys and will rely more on the layers.

## Hand rests

_The height of the two halves is not negligeable_. You might quickly encounter the need to raise your hands with something under your wrists if you did not buy the complete case.

> While you might want to buy a full hand case you should also just look for a bit of wood to cut to the right shape. It makes it easy to have the wrists at the right height.

## Mouse

I prefer to use trackpads and I have the apple one. I put it next to the right half of the ergodox so that I only have to move the right hand without changing my body position. Again it's not because I am lazy but because it makes me keep a better over all posture. Considering how much time I spend in that posture this is not negligeable.

I would consider using something similar to the Thinkpad touch point in the future as I spotted a DIY version online.

Moving one hand away from the ergodox is a bit of a trouble once you are used to it so I also started to rely a bit more on the keyboard to navigate around including for the web browser or switching from one window to another.

> Having the mouse or the trackpad in the right place next to one of the halves will quickly be a constraint for you.


## The experience goes on

I am quite happy to have ordered and built this keyboard. People at work find it a bit odd but I don't care and while some of the other devs have tried it most people don't even ask more than what it is.

Carrying the thing around makes it a bit pointless if you are not planning to stay in one spot for hours. I would consider either using the laptop's keyboard or something like an Atreus for the short stays.

I use blank white and green keycaps and I regret a bit the white color as it tend to look dirty easily. I have ordered another custom keyset so I will replace those at some point but using blank keys is quite nice in the end. Since there is nothing written on the keys it forced me to quickly remember where each key is and probably helped get the layout in mind.

After those 3 or 4 weeks I really like the fact that it forced me to sit in a better position on my seat and get better at typing by using a better technique.

I will probably look into getting an Atreus or making a similar one in the near future as there is less keys with a bigger reliance on the layers. I am curious to see if it feels better to use.

Having LEDs to display the current layer is a must I think it really made the use of the keyboard a nicer experience.
