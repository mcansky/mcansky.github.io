Well folks, that's it : I am now based in UK. I am no more self employed, I am working for the Fevore group, in their software centered company called Salesmaster.

## Be kind, rewind

Several months ago I noticed a decline in my possible work contacts, on the personnal side I decided to change some things too. The basic reasonning behind all this is simple : I am not getting younger, and if I want to be able to settle down with some proper experience in the next ten years I need to join a project and team.

As I have traveled in the past it was quite easy for me to pick a destination outside of France. Little did I know about real relocation not just "grab your backpack, we going to live in Australia's hostels."

## Travel

The first part is quite easy : open a browser, book a flight to London (yes, London : fish, chips, ...) with a couple of interviews scheduled or plans to hit all the doors in Shoreditch to find one that might be interesting.

Two days prior to my flight I went to checkout the London Ruby User Group mailing list archive, one of the last 3 threads was a job posting. An hour later I had an interview scheduled.

## Dungeon

That interview went really well. I had done a bit of homework, so did Jamie. And two hours later we shook hands for the plan to see me coming in the next tuesday to start working as contractor. The possibility to invoice them with my french company turned out to be strategic and handy. We initially hoped to be able to switch to full employment status in the following weeks, but that's were things started to be difficult.

## Monster

The beast is called Paperwork, it's old, hideous, entrenched but quite passive. Remember where I started at : french citizen, flying in to work. As a European Citizen I don't need any visa to work in UK, but that doesn't mean it's that easy.

## Treasure

The modern english Graal : the proof of address. Anyone moving in a new country plan 3 things at the top of their list :

* opening a bank account
* finding a flat
* getting sorted out regarding taxes

I know from experience that the first 2 ones are hell in France, quite easy as long as you have cash in Australia. Now I know that in UK the last one is easy the first two are a big pain.

To open a bank account, as european citizen, you'll require a piece of ID (passport, national ID card) and two proof of addresses (electricity or gas bill, letting contract for a flat, internet bill, governement agencies' letters).

To rent a flat, you need the exact same things.

The idea behind the requirement of a proof of address is to assert your history in UK and that you are not trying to launder money (for the bank), or trying to setup a meth lab (for the real estate agency).

By now you have probably guessed my problem : as I am moving in from another country I have not history in UK, hence : no proof of address. What I had was these :

* a contract with an employer
* a temporary address at a friend's place
* a letter from a gov agency stating my temporary address and my national insurance number (used for taxed purposes)

I have tried no less than 4 banks : Barclays, MetroBank, Lloyds and First Direct (HSBC). All of them first told me "no, can't do". I always needed one more proof of address, the fact that I needed to get a flat and a bank account to get the flat was no use.

**UPDATE** : I forgot one part about Lloyds : it could and should have worked with them. Several french people told me that Lloyds was the place to go to get an account, they only require an ID to start the process. So I did go to Lloyds or rather I started the process over internet then stopped by one local branch to drop the paperwork and get my passport checked and copied. The lady that handed me back my passport told me "it should only be a couple of weeks before you receive your welcome package". Four weeks later I am still waiting.

Two weeks after stopping by the local branch I needed the bank account to get payment from a sale. I went to the the closest Lloyds branch I could find, and asked if my account was ready to receive funds. The cashier told me she could not find any account by my name, and that it probably meant the process was stuck somewhere. They have my temporary address in London, my phone number and my email address, still no news from them, no request for additionnal information.


## The tavern

I am now closer to getting things sorted out. In fact, I am probably days away from having all. Thanks to my employer I managed to get past the guards at the real estate agency and I am now living in 2 bed rooms flat 6 mins away from  work. It's quite empty while I sort how to get things flown in from France but hey, it's nice to sleep in my own place. I did grab a mattress at IKEA, so you can picture me sleeping on a mattress on a floor, drug addict style.

The bank has also been sorted out thanks to my employer's bank contact. After weeks of failures with banks, and since I could not wait for the flat I asked the CTO if we could get in contact with the company's bank to get things sorted out. Three hours later I received an email from Barclays, asking me for some details to get things started. A week later, after a trip to a local Barclays branch to get papers sent through internal mail, I received a confirmation that my account was now open. In few days I should receive a letter with the account details etc ...

## Epilogue

A few things you might be interested to know  if you are moving in UK :

* bring some cash with you, like a pile of it. It will save you transfer and conversion fees. Yes you will have to change them to pounds but it will be cheaper than paying 4 euros for every cash withdrawal or 0.4 euro per shopping session.
* check with your bank if they have a UK branch or special links with a bank in UK. HSBC for example is well established in many EU countries having an account with them in your home country might help to open one in UK (need to be checked)
* The really tricky part is the proof of address, you probably can go around that requirement with most real estate agency as long as you arrange for money to be wired from your oversees account at first. They mostly want to be paid and have some insurance you will not run away after destroying the flat. Once you got a flat you have one proof of address. Getting internet or an insurance will get you the second one.
* in UK flat and house owners take care of most of the insurance, contrary to France it is not mandatory for you to have an insurance when you move in a flat or house you are renting. You can easily get a "Contents only" insurance from your bank (if you have one already) or big insurances (Aviva, ...) directly online.

Life in UK is ok, it's of course not as sunny as Australia but it's much more dense which make a lot of things easier. Coming from France there are several bigcultural differences that you will spot quickly : in the subway, on the escalators, on the road ... Still people are more relaxed and friendly when talked too, I am definitly positively surprised of how much more friendler people living in London are compared to people living in Paris.

It's also too early to draw big conclusions, yet I think that as long as you are aware of the difficulties lying ahead moving to UK is quite possible and enjoyable.
